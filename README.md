# Contact Book

After learning **File I/O in Python** in class, I decided to apply what I learned by building this project — a simple yet functional **Contact Book web app** using **Flask** and **CSV** for data storage.

## About the Project
This project demonstrates how to manage contact information using **Python’s file handling** concepts in a real-world application.  
It’s a browser-based Contact Book that supports user authentication, CSV data storage, PDF export, and light/dark theme toggling.
